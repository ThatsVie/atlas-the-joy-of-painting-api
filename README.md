## Overview
This project celebrates Bob Rossâ€™s *The Joy of Painting* by creating a centralized API and an accompanying Single Page Application (SPA) to explore all 403 episodes of the series. Users can filter episodes by:

- **Year**
- **Month**
- **Subjects**
- **Colors**
- **Season**

The project demonstrates a full-stack implementation, featuring data processing (ETL), backend development, and a user-friendly frontend.

---

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline**: Clean, transform, and load data from multiple CSV sources into MongoDB.
- **RESTful API**: Endpoints support filtering by year, month, subjects, colors, and season.
- **React SPA**: Responsive and interactive interface for exploring episodes.
- **Filter Functionality**:
  - **Year**: Search for episodes by one or more years.
  - **Month**: Filter episodes aired in a specific month.
  - **Subjects**: Discover episodes with specific painted elements.
  - **Colors**: Find episodes using particular paint colors.
  - **Season**: Quickly locate episodes from a specific season.
- **Pagination**: Navigate between pages of results.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices for a seamless experience.
- **Quote Carousel**: A dynamic carousel displays inspirational quotes from Bob Ross to immerse users in the spirit of *The Joy of Painting*.

### Accessing the API
The backend API is accessible at:

[Backend on Vercel](https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes)

#### Example Queries

<details>
<summary>Filtering by Year, Month, Subject, and/or Color</summary>

- **Query episodes from the year 1983 (Page 1, 12 episodes per page):**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?years=1983&page=1&limit=12

- **Query episodes from January 1984:**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?years=1984&months=January

- **Query episodes featuring "TREES" painted in 1993 (Page 1, 12 episodes per page):**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?years=1993&subjects=TREES&page=1&limit=12

- **Query episodes where "Phthalo Green" was used in 1983 (Page 2, 12 episodes per page):**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?years=1983&colors=Phthalo+Green&page=2&limit=12

- **Query episodes aired in February across all years featuring "RIVER" (Page 1, 12 episodes per page):**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?months=February&subjects=RIVER&page=1&limit=12

- **Query episodes from December 1990 that feature "TREE" and use "Sap Green":**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?years=1990&months=December&subjects=TREE&colors=Sap+Green
  
  **Note:** This query will return no results as no episode meets all these criteria.  
  **Response:**  
  
```json
  {
    "episodes": [],
    "totalEpisodes": 0,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 0
  }
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Filtering by Season (1-31)</summary>

- **Query all episodes from Season 1:**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?season=1

- **Query all episodes from Season 15 (Page 2, 12 episodes per page):**  
  https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/episodes?season=15&page=2&limit=12  

  **Note:** This query will only return one episode because each season contains exactly 13 episodes. Since pagination is set to display 12 episodes per page, Page 1 will include the first 12 episodes, and Page 2 will display the remaining single episode.  

```json
{
  "episodes": [
    {
      "_id": "674139c76b21f672b5bca975",

## Process Narrative

1. **ETL Pipeline**:
   - Raw data from three CSV files was cleaned and consolidated into a single dataset (`clean_data.csv`).
   - Python scripts (`clean_data.py`, `populate_data.py`) were used to transform and load the data into MongoDB.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**.
   - API supports advanced filtering and pagination.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Developed as a **React SPA**.
   - Integrated filters and pagination using Axios and state management.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Both backend and frontend were deployed using **Vercel**.
   - Environment variables were configured for both development and production.
   - Backend deployed at: https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/
   - Frontend deployed at: https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api-whkc.vercel.app/
