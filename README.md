## Overview
This project celebrates Bob Ross‚Äôs *The Joy of Painting* by creating a centralized API and an accompanying Single Page Application (SPA) to explore all 403 episodes of the series. Users can filter episodes by:

- **Year**
- **Month**
- **Subjects**
- **Colors**
- **Season**

The project demonstrates a full-stack implementation, featuring data processing (ETL), backend development, and a user-friendly frontend.

---

- **Data Relationships**:
  - The `colors` and `subjects` fields are embedded arrays, meaning they are stored directly within the `episodes` collection. These are not references to other collections, so there are no traditional "many-to-many" relationships.
- **Storage Context**:
  - This structure is optimized for MongoDB, leveraging its ability to handle arrays and nested data without requiring joins as in a relational database.
- **Design Purpose**:
  - The schema is tailored to store metadata about episodes and their paintings efficiently, providing all relevant information in a single document for fast access.

## Process Narrative

1. **ETL Pipeline**:
   - Raw data from three CSV files was cleaned and consolidated into a single dataset (`clean_data.csv`).
   - Python scripts (`clean_data.py`, `populate_data.py`) were used to transform and load the data into MongoDB.

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Mongoose**.
   - API supports advanced filtering and pagination.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Developed as a **React SPA**.
   - Integrated filters and pagination using Axios and state management.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Both backend and frontend were deployed using **Vercel**.
   - Environment variables were configured for both development and production.
   - Backend deployed at: https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api.vercel.app/
   - Frontend deployed at: https://atlas-the-joy-of-painting-api-whkc.vercel.app/

## About the Developer

Hi, I‚Äôm Vie! üòä This project started as a school assignment to create an API, but I decided to run with it üöÄ and turn it into a full-stack application. The front end was optional, but I wanted to challenge myself and bring the project to life üé®.

Through this journey, I gained valuable experience with MongoDB and Vercel, and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished üí™. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to combine my love of coding with my admiration for Bob Ross and his ability to find joy in the process üåà.

‚ÄúGo out on a limb ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the fruit is.‚Äù üçé - Bob Ross

With love, 

‚ù§Ô∏è Vie ‚ù§Ô∏è
